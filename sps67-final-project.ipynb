    "# Motivation for best neighborhood\n",
    "**By: Simon Schueller (sps67)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The best neighborhood will have the most assets, little assets for charity and for the elderly, since a younger population is desireable. Lots of recreational, educational, healthcare, and buisness assets. The most important metric though is having the most assets out of any other neighborhood. When analyzing the Allegheny County Assets data set, I developed a few metrics to interpret this data. Basically, the assets can be categorized as Charity, for the Elderly, Recreational, Educational, Healthcare, Buisness, and Public works. Each of these categories is given a base point value with some flexibility to adjust case by case. This point value determines its overall weight upon finding the best neighborhood. The neighborhood with the highest overall value between all of its assets is deemed most desireable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the point value breakdown for each category:\n",
    "* Charity: -5\n",
    "* For the elderly: -2\n",
    "* Recreational: +3\n",
    "* Educational: +3\n",
    "* Healthcare: +2\n",
    "* Buisness: +1\n",
    "* Public works: +1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Neighborhood\n",
    "Based on how the asset metrics are defined, the overall best neighborhood will have many assets compared to the other neighborhoods. Few of those assets will be for charity and the elderly, many will be educatinal or recreational and there will also be lots of healthcare, buissnesses, and public works.\n",
